	Wireless technology has enormous potential to change the way people and things
	communicate. Future wireless networks will allow people on the move to communicate with
	anyone, anywhere, and at any time using a range of high-performance multimedia services.
	Wireless and mobile networks can also enable a new class of intelligent home electronics,
	smart and energy-efficient buildings and highways, and in-body networks for analysis and
	treatment of medical conditions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	OpenFlow has been proposed as a means for researchers, network service creators, and others
	to easily design, test, and deploy their innovative ideas in experimental or production
	networks to accelerate research activities on wired or wireless network technologies. Rather
	than having programmability within each network node, the separated OpenFlow controller
	provides network control through pluggable software modules. We demonstrate the wireless
	control through OpenFlow controller and further attempt to incorporate it into mobile
	networks.
