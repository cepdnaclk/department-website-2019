                    <p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:10px;">Biomechanics is the study of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on the skeletal structure on body using mechanics. It has applications in both medicine and sports, but the systems used are costly and complex. Our system for studying biomechanics uses off the shelf hardware and open software. We describe how skeletal joint coordinates captured using a Microsoft Kinect are fed into Stanford University's OpenSim system to visualise movement. A rigid body analysis of the arm has been done as a preliminary step towards a full musculoskeletal analysis of motion.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:10px;">This project involves observing breathing abnormalities of babies who are less than one-year-old. Optical flow is used for identifying the motion of infants. In motion identifying process, many techniques have been used to filter noise and extract exact breathing motion of infants. Then the identified breathing motion is analyzed using various methods for identifying abnormalities from the breathing of the babies. With these analyzing methods some basic breathing distortions such as stopping of breathing suddenly (apnoea), hiccups, breathing difficulties, and changes in breathing frequency could be identified. By identifying many such abnormalities, this project can be extended to a real system that would help doctors to get warning when some breathing issues occurred on babies under observation.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:10px;">The original interest of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was to deal with problems that are related to the cocktail-party problem which is a kind of blind source separation problem. Subsequently there were lots of interest in ICA and it has become clear that ICA has a lot of other interesting applications such as electrical recordings of brain activity as a representation of electroencephalogram (EEG). This situation is almost identical to the cocktail-party problem.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:10px;">When considering different implementations of ICA, different implementation gives different performance and accuracy for the user. The main goal of this project was to improve the performance by throughput while maintaining the original accuracy. Because in Brain Computer Interface, there would be some data samples that needs more computation power. To improve the performance, our main approach was to run the algorithm in parallel.</p>
                    <p style="font-size:12pt; margin-top:10px;">For achieving this goal, we used data-level parallelism, thread based parallelism and parallel processing with MPI (Message Passing Interface), hybrid (threads+MPI) approach. With theses approaches, we could achieve 176x performance improvement for 118 sources and 15000 sample dataset compared to the non-parallel version.</p>
